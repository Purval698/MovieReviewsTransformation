This DBT project transforms movie review data by standardizing text, converting it to lowercase, and utilizing seeds for static data. It employs snapshots to handle Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2 (SCD2) for historical tracking. The data's integrity is ensured through testing for null and unique values. This process creates a clean, reliable dataset for downstream analysis.
